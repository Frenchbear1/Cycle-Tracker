# Cycle Tracker

A simple, single-page cycle tracker. Built because I was on a mission to find a “boyfriend tool” to track when it was *time* — and couldn’t find one, so I made one instead.

**Features**
- Quick cycle date tracking
- Simple, distraction-free UI
- Runs entirely in the browser (single HTML file)
